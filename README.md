1. Brainstorming

I had the following ideas for games, which I reject. The first was too simple, and the third was too hard.

### Game 1
**Title:** Riddle Me This  
**Idea:** Mythology quiz  
**Aim:** Guess the questions about mythology right to win the game  
**Start:** You start with Norse mythology with a background set in Scandinavia  
**Progression:** Answer each question correctly to progress to the next question, in a new place  
**How to win:** Guess all of the 15 questions right  
**How to lose:** Three wrong answers in a row or less than total 12 right  
**Look:** With each question, the user will see a different country background and a different character the question relates to  
**Scoring:** The number of questions left, correct answers and incorrect answers is shown on the right of the screen

### Game 2
**Title:** Skull ’n’ Bones
Idea: You are a wizard defending a forest - but the Skull King is coming to destroy it!  
**Aim:** Protect your trees
Start: You start in front of your forest with the trees at your back when the Skull King suddenly appears  
**Progression:** Collect random potions that appear and fire spells at the the skull  
**How to win:** Hit the skull enough times before your trees are all destroyed 
**How to lose:** Get hit by the mini-skulls that the Skull King fires at you, or all your trees are destroyed  
**Look:** Green background, trees to the left, forest to the bottom and top  
**Scoring:** A health bar on the player’s side shows their health and trees remaining, a health bar on the Skull King’s side shows his health

2. My idea

<!-- ### Game 2
**Title:** Odyssey  
**Idea:** You wake up in the Underworld - and you don’t know who you are! Oh no! You don’t belong here at all! You have to get home!  
**Aim:** Get to the other side of the River Styx 
**Start:** You start next to a gate on the banks of the River Styx - the portal to get out is on the other side. The Ferry Man wants you to guess your name to allow you to cross.  
**Progression:** For each correct guess you move forward across the river  
**How to win:** Guess the letters in your name before your guesses run out  
**How to lose:** Fail to solve the puzzle in enough moves and you will be trapped in the Underworld forever  
**Look:** Player is next to a gate on the shore on the right of the screen, background is starry sky, cave ceiling look at the top, the river on the bottom, the Ferry Man is in the boat next to the shore on the right of the screen, the portal is on the left of the screen  
**Scoring:** The number of guesses left is shown on the bottom of the screen, number of spaces left to cross the river is next to this -->

3. Wireframe and user stories **IN PROGRESS**
4. Create repo and starting files (.js, .css., .html) **DONE**
5. Break each one down by requirements

<!-- Create a repository on github enterprise for your project
Clone it to the projects folder on your computer
Add an HTML, CSS, and JS file to the folder
Connect the CSS and JS file to your HTML file and test that they all work
Build the most basic version of your website board in HTML and CSS (very little styling, just a first version)
Write the pseudocode for website logic as comments in your JS file
Choose the correct data type for how your website board should be represented in JS
Add jQuery to your HTML file if you would like to use it instead of vanilla JavScript.
Begin working on the [user stories], 1 at a time
Deploy your application to github pages
